> ## Task 1, Exception Handling
> The Java programming language uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional events. This lesson describes when and how to use exceptions.
> 
> What is an Exception?
>> An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
> How to Throw Exceptions
>> All methods use the throw statement to throw an exception. The throw statement requires a single argument: a throwable object. 
>> Throwable objects are instances of any subclass of the Throwable class. Here is an example:
>> 
>> -*throw someThrowableObject*
>> 
> What is the purpose of throw statements.
>> The purpose of this statement is to throw an exception and by providing any class that inherits the
`Throwable` (an exception object) class which will be handed to the runtime system.
>>
> Which classes inherit Throwable class.
>> The `Error` and `Exception` classes, representing serious problems that the code should not catch
and disruptions in the normal flow that the program could recover from respectively.
